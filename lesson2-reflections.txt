I will record my reflections for Lesson 2 here

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created for storing a hsitory of commits. This is a required
	step before you are able to commit anything to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area almost lies between the two. It contains only those files that are part of 
	the working directory that will form part of the repository and as such defines what will
	be part of the repository.
