I will record my reflections for Lesson 2 here

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created for storing a hsitory of commits. This is a required
	step before you are able to commit anything to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area almost lies between the two. It contains only those files that are part of 
	the working directory that will form part of the repository and as such defines what will
	be part of the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By adding individaul "logical changes" using the git add filename[s] and then commiting these one at a
	time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	
	Brachs would be helpful when creating significant changes that need to be worked on in parrallel or where a
	split in devlopment objectived occurs e.g. different version, experiment with new feature etc.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They help differentiate between branches and the commits within branches - thus also helping to ensure that
	you do not create unreachable commits.
